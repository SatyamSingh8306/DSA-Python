## Contributing Guidelines
We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels! To maintain consistency and quality, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Contribution Scope**:
   - Submit a pull request for **one method or functionality at a time**. This ensures focused and modular contributions.

2. **Pull Request Naming Convention**:
   - Name your pull request as follows:
     ```
     [Data Structure Name] - [Method Name]
     ```
     For example:
     ```
     Stack - Push
     ```

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Ensure your code is well-structured, readable, and follows Pythonic principles (e.g., PEP 8).
   - Include comments to explain complex logic (if applicable).
   - Provide test cases for the implemented method.

4. **File Structure**:
   - Place your code in the appropriate folder (e.g., `src/stack/` for stack-related methods).
   - Use meaningful and descriptive file names.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Include a brief description of the method at the top of your file.
   - Document inputs, outputs, and any edge cases handled.

6. **Code Review**:
   - Be open to suggestions during the review process.
